	<p>Q.Will the site you build for me fit on phones, tablets and laptops?<br>
	
        Ans. The answer is yes.  Pallasart websites are responsive. We will build your site so that all visitors to it will have an optimal viewing experience.
	        Your site will easily resize to fit any device - from mobile phones to desktop computer monitors. We will carefully craft versions of your site for 
	        viewing and easy navigation on differently sized laptop and notebook computers. Your web visitors will love the site we build for you.</p><br>


       <p>Q.What language do you use to program your sites?<br>

       Ans. We generally build our websites in PHP with MySQL databases.PHP (Hypertext Pre-Processor) is a server-side web programming language that is 
		    widely used for web development.  PHP is the most popular web scripting language and has its roots in C and C++. MySQL is an open source database 
		    format that can be interfaced with PHP. Therefore, PHP and MySQL are excellent choice for webmasters looking to automate their web sites. PHP can 
		    run on both UNIX and Windows servers. PHP also has powerful output buffering that further increases over the output flow. PHP internally rearranges
		    the buffer so that headers come before contents. PHP is dynamic. PHP can add dynamic elements into an HTML coded page.PHP can be used with a large
		    number of relational database management systems, runs on all of the most popular web servers and is available for many different operating systems.
		    PHP5 a fully object oriented language and its platform independence and speed on Linux server often makes it the best choice to build large and 
		    complex web applications. In general PHP is open-source, secure, fast and reliable for developing web applications.</p><br>

       <p>Q.We want a site that is easy to change and update ourselves. Are Pallasart sites easy to update?<br> 

      Ans.Every site we build is unique and designed specifically to a customer's exact specifications.Each site has its own CMS (content management system)
	      which is password-protected.  It is extremely easy to use and allows customers to add pages, pictures and graphics, change text, add blog entries and 
	      articles, manage store inventory, customer orders, a mailing list and newsletters - and many other things.</p><br>



       <p>Q.Do the costs generally go up in the design process?<br>

     Ans.All of our projects are fixed bid quote.We give a discount for multiple sites being done at one time.Our terms are 50% at the time the site is
	     commissioned and the balance when it is completed. Once the site is done there is be a period of 30 days when corrections and adjustments within the 
	     original scope of work are done to the site at no charge.<p>
